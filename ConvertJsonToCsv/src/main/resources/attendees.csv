We're creating the first “whole cut” fermentation-derived seafood alternatives. Our technology allows us to biomanufacture a sustainable seafood analog through the growth and fermentation of mycelium. Aqua Cultured Foods has developed novel protein fermentation technology that produces seafood alternatives with the appearance, texture, taste and nutritional content of conventional seafood -- and without microplastics, mercury, antibiotics, PCBs, parasites, or a high risk of foodborne illness.This technology can be leveraged across platforms to create different types of seafood including shrimp, calamari, sushi cuts and fish filet substitutes. \n\nAnne Palermo is the CEO & Co-Founder of Aqua Cultured Foods, a leading future food startup in the alt protein space. After recently closing the largest pre-seed round in alt seafood, Anne is focused on using Aqua’s novel fermentation technology to bring to market nutritionally superior, hyper-realistic, whole cuts of seafood alternatives. Anne began her career in finance before transitioning into food tech, food science and culinary innovation with the launch of her first cpg company. While there, she developed proprietary technology pertaining to manufacturing processes and the product formulations used in a high protein snacking platform. She quickly scaled the company to a multimillion dollar run rate.","CEO & Cofounder","Aqua Cultured Foods",,"Chicago","en-gb","https://events-cdn.grip.events/things-images/453f71928c6cb25fad654350560287c5_1663779258.png",6134.0,1.0,"Attendee",1.0,0.0,1.662685918E9,1.0,1.0,1.663787152E9,"/1/container/4685/thing/6822000",,"5452","5452","Attendee","Attendee",0.0,"normal",,,,,,,,,0.0,,,"hybrid",4685.0,,,,,,,,,,4685.0,6134.0,"true","true","Attendee","Attendee","Attendee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal is to match startup solutions to our customer pain points, providing additional value to our customers, strengthening our client relationships, and providing market traction to startups.\n\nWe look for startups creating solutions that address needs our customers face.  B2B startups, targeting mid-to enterprise customers, have the opportunity to join our accelerator program.  Once accepted, the startup will work directly with some of our twelve thousand plus consultants that are working in a variety of markets.  These consultant-advisors will help the startups connect to our marquee customers and partners. These connections can help shape product/market fit through customer interviews, pilots, and even direct sales.  Gaining this market traction not only accelerates growth, but positions the startups for follow-on funding with our venture partners.\n\nSo, if you’re in the business of helping companies do a better job in financial services, entertainment, CPG, retail, or any of our market verticals, we want to hear from you.

Industries include, but are not limited to: planetary health, fintech, digital health, B2B, and web3 (crypto). \n\nAt iBOS, he incubated and founded OOTify (proof-of-care mental health web3 platform) after losing his tennis partner and family members to mental illness. Ravi believes that solving the navigation and utilization issues in mental healthcare is the issue of our generation.\n\nPrior to iBOS and OOTify, Mr. Sharma was a portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. (Western Asset) and was personally responsible for approximately $1.3 billion AUM (assets under management). Prior to Western Asset, he worked at PNMAC Capital Management, Arch Bay Capital, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He also successfully had two (2) exits in healthcare and clean-technology in 2010 as an operator.\n\nHe currently also volunteers as an advisor on the board of the Volunteers of America Community Health Incubator, which is sponsored by the Humana Foundation to launch and scale social enterprises that improve quality, equity and access to care for at-risk populations.\n\nRavi completed his education at the University of Southern California and his latest passion project is a Children's Mental Health Book he wrote after recently becoming a father. The book speaks to physical health and mental health parity and is a great conversation starter to start talking about mental health early.
